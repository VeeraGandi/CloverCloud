# Clover Remote Pay Cloud Tutorial

## Before We Start

### What We're Building

Today, we're going to integrate a browser-based Point of Sale (POS) system with a Cloud Pay Display-eligible Clover device (Clover Mini, Mobile or Flex).

We've already built a simple UI of the POS for you. However, in its current state, the POS cannot connect to a Clover device, and most of the buttons do nothing. In this tutorial, we will be building that functionality.

It is important to complete this tutorial in its entirety. We will be learning both how to build an integration as well as implementation best practices, so you can avoid very common mistakes and edge cases. Ultimately, this tutorial is meant to help you quickly ship quality code to production with confidence.

This tutorial uses the remote-pay-cloud's  [`CloverConnector`](https://clover.github.io/remote-pay-cloud-api/1.4.2/remotepay.ICloverConnector.html) interface to connect to a Clover device and perform operations over the cloud. The CloverConnector provides a consolidated asynchronous interface for your POS to integrate with Clover's customer-facing payment devices.

### Prerequisites

We'll assume some familiarity with HTML and JavaScript, but you should be able to follow along even if you haven't used them before.

For the sake of keeping this tutorial lightweight and easy to understand, we are keeping it agnostic of any frontend JavaScript framework. As a result, some adaptation may be required to implement the same behavior into your own POS, depending on your own tech stack.

We recommend reading an [Overview of the Clover Platform](https://docs.clover.com/build/architecture/), including the [Developer Guidelines](https://docs.clover.com/build/developer-guidelines/).

You will need to [order a Clover Developer Kit (DevKit)](https://cloverdevkit.com/) and [set it up](https://docs.clover.com/build/devkit/). An emulator cannot be used, because our Secure Payments application relies on certain aspects of our hardware. Currently, the Clover Mini, Mobile, and Flex are eligible for semi-integration.

Our JavaScript remote-pay-cloud SDK is distributed as an npm package. If you do not already have npm installed, [install it](https://www.npmjs.com/get-npm).

You will need to [set up a Sandbox developer account](https://sandbox.dev.clover.com/developers) and create your test merchant.

### How to Follow Along

You should keep this document open to follow along while completing the tutorial in your favorite text editor. As you progress, making and saving JavaScript changes, the POS will hot-reload in your browser of choice.

### Help, I'm Stuck!

If you get stuck, check out Clover's [Community support resources](https://community.clover.com/). If you don't find someone with the same question, post a new one, and we'll help you out.

With this out of the way, let's get started!

## Setup

After you have completed setup of your Clover DevKit, find and install the **Cloud Pay Display** application from the App Market. Go ahead and touch the four corners of the device's screen to exit Cloud Pay Display. When it re-launches programmatically, you'll know you've accomplished the first major milestone of this tutorial â€” device pairing.

`git clone https://github.com/Tulen/cloudpaytut-mock.git` to clone this repository locally. `cd cloudpaytut-mock` to navigate to the project's root directory, and then run `npm install`. This will install `webpack` and `webpack-dev-server`, along with Clover's `remote-pay-cloud` and `remote-pay-cloud-api` libraries are needed to connect to and communicate with the device.

Run `npm run build` to start webpack-dev-server, which will bundle your files and enable hot reloading.

Open a new browser tab and [login to your Sandbox Developer Account](https://sandbox.dev.clover.com/home/login). Find the **Remote Pay Cloud Tutorial** app in the App Market. Install and launch it, and Clover will redirect you to https://localhost:8080, including a few query parameters with the redirect which we will explain shortly. You should see a simple Point of Sale system.

**Note:** These query parameters are required for device pairing. If you do not complete this tutorial in one browser session, you will need to re-launch the Remote Pay Cloud Tutorial from the Sandbox Clover website to resume your progress.

Open the project's root directory in your favorite text editor. We will first be editing `index.js`.

## Getting Started

### Device Pairing

We'll first need to build the device pairing between our POS and the Clover customer-facing device.

The POS has a green 'Connect' button which has a bound `onclick` handler to invoke a `connect()` function that we have defined in `index.js`. We'll make the `connect()` function pair the devices.

To successfully `connect()` to the Clover device, we'll require:
* The `merchant_id`
* An `access_token`
* The `targetCloverDomain` - either Clover's Sandbox or Production environment.
* The `remoteApplicationId` of the POS.
* The `deviceId` of the Clover device you are connecting to. This is different than the device's serial number, and we'll discuss this more in depth shortly.
* A `friendlyId` - a human-readable way to identify the current POS. We'll also discuss this more in depth.

The `merchant_id` was passed to your POS as a query parameter when you launched your POS from Clover. We'll grab it using regex, and assign it to a property of the `RemotePayCloudTutorial` object that gets instantiated when the page loads (see `index.html`).

```diff
RemotePayCloudTutorial = function() {
- // TODO: set instance variables for CloverConnector configuration  
+ this.merchant_id = window.location.href.match(/merchant_id=([^&]*)/)[1];
};
```

The `access_token` was also passed to your POS as a query parameter. This is because our Remote Pay Cloud Tutorial does not have a backend server, so we have configured it to redirect to our POS with an `access_token` rather than a `code`. To read more about how to securely obtain an `access_token` using your own POS's backend server, please reference our [OAuth documentation](https://docs.clover.com/build/oauth-2-0/).

```diff
RemotePayCloudTutorial = function() {
  this.merchant_id = window.location.href.match(/merchant_id=([^&]*)/)[1];
+ this.access_token = window.location.href.match(/access_token=([^&]*)/)[1];
};
```

The `client_id` was also passed to your POS as a query parameter. If you are using a `code` response type, as previously mentioned, you would need this `client_id` to obtain an `access_token`. However, since we already have an `access_token`, we will ignore this query parameter.

Clover maintains [different environments for Sandbox and Production](https://docs.clover.com/build/web-apps/#before-you-begin-sandbox-vs-production). The `targetCloverDomain` specifies which one you would like to connect to. In this tutorial, we'll assume you want to target our Sandbox environment while you're developing, and our Production environment for your deployed web application.

```diff
RemotePayCloudTutorial = function() {
  this.merchant_id = window.location.href.match(/merchant_id=([^&]*)/)[1];
  this.access_token = window.location.href.match(/access_token=([^&]*)/)[1];
+ this.targetCloverDomain = window.location.href.includes("localhost") ? "https://sandbox.dev.clover.com" : "https://www.clover.com";
};
```

The `remoteApplicationId` is a constant value for your particular POS, and is used by Clover's Engineering team to track SDK usage, as well as to help triage issues, if you encounter any. Learn more about creating your own `remoteApplicationId` [here](https://docs.clover.com/build/create-your-remote-app-id/). For this tutorial, we'll provide our own `remoteApplicationId` that we have created, but for your own semi-integrated POS, this value needs to be replaced with your own unique `remoteApplicationId`.

```diff
RemotePayCloudTutorial = function() {
  this.merchant_id = window.location.href.match(/merchant_id=([^&]*)/)[1];
  this.access_token = window.location.href.match(/access_token=([^&]*)/)[1];
  this.targetCloverDomain = window.location.href.includes("localhost") ? "https://sandbox.dev.clover.com" : "https://www.clover.com";
+ this.remoteApplicationId = "com.tutorial.remote.pay.cloud";
};
```

The `friendlyId` is a human-readable way to identify the current POS. Certain error messages will include `friendlyId`s. For example, if a Clover device is currently connected to a POS via semi-integration, and a *different* POS also attempts to initiate a connection, the second POS will receive an error message stating that it is already connected to first POS' `friendlyId`. Let's refer to our POS as the "Primary POS".

```diff
RemotePayCloudTutorial = function() {
  this.merchant_id = window.location.href.match(/merchant_id=([^&]*)/)[1];
  this.access_token = window.location.href.match(/access_token=([^&]*)/)[1];
  this.targetCloverDomain = window.location.href.includes("localhost") ? "https://sandbox.dev.clover.com" : "https://www.clover.com";
  this.remoteApplicationId = "com.tutorial.remote.pay.cloud";
+ this.friendlyId = "Primary POS";
};
```

The `deviceId` was *not* passed to us as a query parameter. It's also different from (but associated with) the device's serial number, so the merchant will not be able to manually enter this `deviceId` value, either. As such, we will use Clover's [REST APIs](https://docs.clover.com/build/web-api/) to fetch all of the devices associated with the merchant. We'll render a list of the serial numbers, which can be validated by the merchant to determine which device to connect to, and then we will connect to the `deviceId` of the serial number that the merchant selects.

First, we'll create an empty `select` element above the 'Connect' button that we'll eventually populate with those `option`s.

In `index.html`:

```diff
<div class="pos--container tdshadow">

- <!-- TODO: insert select element here -->
+  <select id="select--clover-device-serials">
+  </select>

  <div class="numpad--key key--primary" id="key--connect">
    Connect
  </div>
</div>
```

`DOMContentLoaded` is a suitable hook for when we can fetch the device information of all Clover devices belonging to a merchant, and then create an `option` to be rendered in the DOM for each serial number. The `value` of the `option` will be the `deviceId`, which is the parameter we actually need to connect to the device. We'll add those `option`s to the `select` we just created.

In `events.js`:

```diff
  helloWorldKey.addEventListener("click", function() {
    remotePayCloudTutorial.showHelloWorld();
  });
+  
+ fetch(`${remotePayCloudTutorial.targetCloverDomain}/v3/merchants/${remotePayCloudTutorial.merchant_id}/devices?access_token=${remotePayCloudTutorial.access_token}`)
+ .then(function(response) {
+   return response.json();
+ })
+ .then(function(data) {
+   var select = document.getElementById("select--clover-device-serials");
+ 
+   data.elements.forEach(function(device) {
+     if (device.serial === "unknown") {
+       // Exclude Clover emulators
+       return;
+     } else {
+       var option = document.createElement("option");
+       option.text = device.serial;
+       option.value = device.id;
+       select.add(option);
+     }
+   });
+ })    
+ .catch(function(error) {
+   window.alert(error);
+ });
```

**Important:** Receiving a `200 OK` response from this particular REST endpoint required our POS to have *MERCHANT_R* permission. Without this permission, we would have received a `401 Unauthorized` response. Read more about properly configuring permissions in your own POS [here](https://docs.clover.com/build/permissions/).

**Note:** In the above implementation, we chose to create an `option` for all Clover devices, excluding [emulators](https://docs.clover.com/build/android-emulator-setup/), which should only be in use by developers in our Sandbox environment. You, however, might want to only render `option`s for Clover devices which are eligible for Cloud Pay Display (currently, Clover Mini, Clover Mobile, and Clover Flex), and exclude ineligible devices (currently, Clover Station and Clover 2018). In that case, the following code snippet could be used. **However,** as Clover continues our commitment to developing new, best of breed hardware, we may release additional hardware products which are also not Cloud Pay Display eligible. As a result, we realize this particular code block is **not fully future-proof**, should only be used at your own risk, and might require patching in the future. Only use this code snippet if you understand the associated risks.

```javascript
fetch(`${remotePayCloudTutorial.targetCloverDomain}/v3/merchants/${remotePayCloudTutorial.merchant_id}/devices?access_token=${remotePayCloudTutorial.access_token}`)
.then(function(response) {
  return response.json();
})
.then(function(data) {
  var select = document.getElementById("select--clover-device-serials");

  data.elements.forEach(function(device) {
    // Currently, Clover Mobile, Mini and Flex are eligible for Cloud Pay Display.
    // Their serial numbers begin with C02, C03 and C04, respectively.
    var serialFirstThree = device.serial.slice(0, 3);

    // Clover Station and Clover Station 2018 have serial numbers that begin with
    // C01 and C05. They will likely never be eligible for Cloud Pay Display,
    // because they are not the best form factors for a customer-facing screen.
    // Additionally, Clover emulators have a serial of 'unknown'.

    var ineligibleDevicesFirstThree = ["C01", "C05", "unk"];
    if (ineligibleDevicesFirstThree.includes(serialFirstThree)) {
      // Exclude Clover emulators, Clover Stations, and Clover Station 2018's
      return;
    } else {
      var option = document.createElement("option");
      option.text = device.serial;
      option.value = device.id;
      select.add(option);
    }
    // As Clover continues our commitment to developing new, best of breed hardware,
    // we may release additional hardware products which are also not Cloud Pay Display
    // eligible. As a result, we realize this particular code block is not fully
    // future-proof, and should be used at your own risk.
  });
})
.catch(function(error) {
  window.alert(error);
});
```

**Important:** The remote-pay-cloud SDK was developed for a one-to-one pairing between POS and Clover terminal. There is a high probability that issues will arise if you attempt to pair your POS with multiple Clover devices simultaneously. For the most reliable results, please use a one-to-one relationship.

We now have all of the data required to initialize a connection, so let's give the green 'Connect' button functionality. We'll connect to the `deviceId` of the currently selected device `option` in the `select` element we previously created. 

In `index.js`:

```diff
RemotePayCloudTutorial.prototype.connect = function() {
-  // TODO: create a configuration object, a CloverConnector, a 
-  // CloverConnectorListener, and then initialize the connection
+  var deviceId = document.getElementById("select--clover-device-serials").value;
+
+  var args = [this, this.remoteApplicationId, clover.BrowserWebSocketImpl.createInstance, new clover.ImageUtil(), this.targetCloverDomain, this.access_token, new clover.HttpSupport(XMLHttpRequest), this.merchant_id, deviceId, this.friendlyId];
+  
+  var cloverConnectorFactoryConfiguration = {};
+  cloverConnectorFactoryConfiguration[clover.CloverConnectorFactoryBuilder.FACTORY_VERSION] = clover.CloverConnectorFactoryBuilder.VERSION_12;
+  var cloverConnectorFactory = clover.CloverConnectorFactoryBuilder.createICloverConnectorFactory(cloverConnectorFactoryConfiguration);
+
+  // Instantiate a cloverConnector instance using a list of arguments that must
+  // be entered in this order.
+  // In ES6, spread syntax would be a good replacement for .bind.apply();
+  this.cloverConnector = cloverConnectorFactory.createICloverConnector(new (Function.prototype.bind.apply(clover.WebSocketCloudCloverDeviceConfiguration, args)));
+
+  this.cloverConnector.initializeConnection();
};
```

We are accomplishing a few tasks in this code block. First, we are obtaining the `deviceId` of the currently selected serial number. Next, we create an ordered array of arguments that are required to instantiate a `CloverConnector`. We then configure the `CloverConnectorFactory` with a property (`clover.CloverConnectorFactoryBuilder.FACTORY_VERSION = clover.CloverConnectorFactoryBuilder.VERSION_12`) to specify that we are using the currently latest version of the `CloverConnector`. Finally, we instantiate the `CloverConnector` with both our `args` and the help of JavaScript's `apply` method, and initialize its connection.

Under the hood, using the `remote-pay-cloud` SDK, this code will instantiate a WebSocket connection. As such, to follow WebSocket best practices, we need to properly dispose of resources the user navigates to a different page, refreshes the current page, or closes the tab/window. [window.onbeforeunload](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/WindowEventHandlers/onbeforeunload) is the proper `WindowEventHandler` to handle all of these events.

```diff
RemotePayCloudTutorial.prototype.connect = function() {
  // TODO: create a configuration object, a CloverConnector, a 
  // CloverConnectorListener, and then initialize the connection
  var deviceId = document.getElementById("select--clover-device-serials").value;
  
  var args = [this, this.remoteApplicationId, clover.BrowserWebSocketImpl.createInstance, new clover.ImageUtil(), this.targetCloverDomain, this.access_token, new clover.HttpSupport(XMLHttpRequest), this.merchant_id, deviceId, this.friendlyId];
    
  var cloverConnectorFactoryConfiguration = {};
  cloverConnectorFactoryConfiguration[clover.CloverConnectorFactoryBuilder.FACTORY_VERSION] = clover.CloverConnectorFactoryBuilder.VERSION_12;
  var cloverConnectorFactory = clover.CloverConnectorFactoryBuilder.createICloverConnectorFactory(cloverConnectorFactoryConfiguration);
  
  // Instantiate a cloverConnector instance using a list of arguments that must
  // be entered in this order.
  // In ES6, spread syntax would be a good replacement for .bind.apply();
  this.cloverConnector = cloverConnectorFactory.createICloverConnector(new (Function.prototype.bind.apply(clover.WebSocketCloudCloverDeviceConfiguration, args)));

+ this.setDisposalHandler();
  this.cloverConnector.initializeConnection();
};
+
+ RemotePayCloudTutorial.prototype.setDisposalHandler = function() {
+   window.onbeforeunload = function(event) {
+     try {
+       this.cloverConnector.dispose();
+     } catch (e) {
+       console.error(e);
+     }
+   }.bind(this);
+ };
```

Let the webpage hot reload, select the device serial you would like to connect to, and then press the 'Connect' button. You should now see Cloud Pay Display launch on the device, indicating that we have successfully paired devices. Congratulations!

<!-- TODO: "Did Cloud Pay Display not launch? Common troubleshooting here." - link to common mistakes. e.g., Device not connected to the internet? Something else? Blah blah blah? If your issue is not resolved by these common mistakes, and you are still unable to connect to your Clover device, please post a question on our [Clover Developer Community](https://community.clover.com/). -->

### Implement a CloverConnectorListener

We canonically refer to the WebSocket connection we've now created as the `CloverConnector` API. In order to send data from your POS to the Clover device, you will invoke methods on the `CloverConnector` instance. You have already become familiar with `cloverConnector#initializeConnection`.

However, one-way communication is not enough. The device will also need to send payloads of data to your POS through the same WebSocket connection. You'll need to implement a `CloverConnectorListener` to respond to events, keep track of the device's state, and know if transactions succeeded or failed. Our POS will receive information about the Clover device by implementing a number of different callbacks.

We will set a `CloverConnectorListener` on our `CloverConnector` instance before initializing the connection. The `remote-pay-cloud` SDK will hook into these `CloverConnectorListener` callbacks at various stages of the device's lifecycle.

It can also be useful to set a pointer to the `cloverConnector` on the `CloverConnectorListener` instance, so that `cloverConnector` methods can be easily invoked from directly within a `CloverConnectorListener` callback. We will first implement the `onDeviceConnected` and `onDeviceReady` callbacks, which get invoked sequentially during the device pairing process. In this example, we will simply update the UI to indicate that device pairing has been successful. We will also implement the `onDeviceError` callback, allowing us to render any Clover error messages to the user.

```diff
+ this.setCloverConnectorListener(this.cloverConnector);
  this.setDisposalHandler();
  this.cloverConnector.initializeConnection();
};
+
+  RemotePayCloudTutorial.prototype.setCloverConnectorListener = function(cloverConnector) {
+    var CloverConnectorListener = function(connector) {
+      clover.remotepay.ICloverConnectorListener();
+      this.cloverConnector = connector;
+    };
+    
+    CloverConnectorListener.prototype = Object.create(clover.remotepay.ICloverConnectorListener.prototype);
+    CloverConnectorListener.prototype.constructor = CloverConnectorListener;
+    
+    CloverConnectorListener.prototype.onDeviceConnected = function() {
+      document.getElementById("status-message").innerHTML = "Device is connected!";
+    };
+    
+    CloverConnectorListener.prototype.onDeviceReady = function() {
+      document.getElementById("status-message").innerHTML = "Device is connected and ready!";
+    };
+    
+    CloverConnectorListener.prototype.onDeviceError = function(deviceErrorEvent) {
+      window.alert(`Message: ${deviceErrorEvent.getMessage()}`);
+    };
+    
+    this.cloverConnectorListener = new CloverConnectorListener(cloverConnector);
+    cloverConnector.addCloverConnectorListener(this.cloverConnectorListener);
+  };
```

After the page refreshes, re-connect to your device, and "Device is connected and ready!" should be rendered. `onDeviceConnected` and `onDeviceReady` are occasionally invoked very rapidly, to the point where you may never see the "Device is connected!" message on the DOM. However, slow network speeds can contribute to latency and delay.

**Important:** *Never* invoke a `CloverConnector` method from within the `CloverConnectorListener#onDeviceReady` callback. This callback is **not** guaranteed to fire only once, and unintended consequences can arise if you start multiple `TransactionRequests` concurrently.

### Hello World

We will now continue the age old tradition of writing a simple application to render 'Hello World' as its result. Our POS already has a Hello World button on its DOM, and it already has an `onclick` handler. Let's give it functionality.

In `index.js`:

```diff
RemotePayCloudTutorial.prototype.showHelloWorld = function() {
-  // TODO: show a 'Hello World' message on the device
+  this.cloverConnector.showMessage("Hello World");
};
```

Refresh the page, re-connect to the device, and wait for the device to be connected and ready. Click the 'Hello World' button, and ensure "Hello World" is rendered on the Clover device. In practice, the `CloverConnector#showMessage` method can be used, for example, to display a custom welcome message or a deal of the day.

Note that this message will not disappear until another `CloverConnector` method is invoked, or the device/application is disconnected.

### Initiating our first Sale

We are now ready to start our first Sale, one of the three transaction types that Clover semi-integration supports. You can find more detailed information about all of our transaction types [here](https://docs.clover.com/build/semi-integration-transaction-types/). Initiating a Sale requires you to generate a `SaleRequest` instance, which inherits from our `TransactionRequest` class. We'll reference both in this section.

We already have a 'Charge' button, but it does nothing. Let's add some functionality.

In `events.js`, we'll add functionality to the `onclick` handler, parsing the `total` into an `int`, and attempting to start a Sale:

```diff
chargeKey.addEventListener("click", function() {
+  var amount = parseInt(document.getElementById("total").innerHTML.replace(".", ""));
+  // 'amount' is an int of the number of pennies to charge
+  if (amount > 0) {
+    remotePayCloudTutorial.performSale(amount);
+  }
});
```

We'll interact with the actual `cloverConnector` API in `index.js`. Note that we are setting an `ExternalId` on our `SaleRequest`. An `ExternalId` serves a number of different purposes:
1. Your POS can use it to associate your `Order` and `Payment` models with Clover's `Payment` objects.
2. It helps prevent accidental duplicate charges. The Clover device will reject back-to-back `TransactionRequests` that have identical `ExternalId`s.
3. If you use universally unique `ExternalId`s on every transaction, they can be used as a last resort to help Clover Engineering triage issues that may arise with individual transactions. Please note that providing a Clover `PaymentId` will resolve issues quicker. However, there can be rare instances when your POS only knows the `ExternalId` of a `TransactionRequest`, but not its Clover `PaymentId` (e.g., if connectivity between the POS and Clover device is dropped mid-transaction).

For these reasons, **you should persist both ExternalIds and Clover Payments in your database.** We also highly recommend making your `ExternalId`s universally unique. If your POS is not already generating unique Payment IDs, our SDK provides a utility method to generate a 13-digit alphanumeric UUID. While we can't guarantee universal uniqueness, our utility method has only a 1/1,180,591,620,685,165,462,528 chance of collision.

The `ExternalId` is required on every `TransactionRequest`, and must have a length between 1 and 32 characters.

In `index.js`:

```diff
RemotePayCloudTutorial.prototype.performSale = function(amount) {
-  // TODO: use the CloverConnector to initiate a sale
+  var saleRequest = new clover.remotepay.SaleRequest();
+  saleRequest.setAmount(amount);
+  saleRequest.setExternalId(clover.CloverID.getNewId());
+  this.cloverConnector.sale(saleRequest);
};
```

After the webpage reloads, re-establish a connection to the device, enter an amount into the calculator, and press 'Charge'. You should see instructions on the Clover device to process your first card transaction. Swipe/dip/tap to pay, and follow the on-screen instructions.

After you enter your signature on-screen, you might notice the device is "stuck" on this screen. However, this is the intended behavior. The Clover device is waiting for our POS to either approve or reject the customer's signature. The POS, rather than the Clover device, needs to handle this approval/denial, as semi-integrated Clover devices are frequently utilized as being customer-facing only.

![](public/assets/images/verifyingSignature.png)

Exit Cloud Pay Display by touching the four corners of the screen, and let's write some more code. We don't want any of our merchants to get "stuck" at this screen.

**Note:** If you never saw this screen, you'll need to adjust your merchant level settings, and initiate another Sale to reach this point. After exiting Cloud Pay Display, open the **Setup** app, navigate to **Payments**, and scroll down to **Signature Settings**. Set the **Signature entry location** to 'On tablet screen' and the **Signature requirement** to 'Always require signature'.

### Handling signature verification

In this section, we'll render the signature captured on the Clover device onto our POS's DOM, and provide the user with the option of either accepting or denying it. Let's start by providing a `<canvas>` element which we can write our signature to.

In `index.html`:

```diff
<div class="row">
  <div class="col-md-6 logo--container">
    <img src="./assets/clover_logo.png" class="logo"></img>
  </div> 
  <div class="col-md-5 status--container">
    <h3 class="status" id="status-message"> Not connected to your Clover device. Please connect to perform an action. </h3>
  </div>
  
-  <!-- TODO: insert canvas element here -->
  
+  <div class="row pos--container">
+    <div class="col-xs-12">
+      <canvas ref="canvas" width="300" height="175" id="verify-signature-canvas"/>
+    </div> 
+  </div>
</div>
```

Next, we'll need to implement the `CloverConnectorListener#onVerifySignatureRequest` callback that gets invoked at this stage of the transaction lifecycle. In that method, we will render the signature on the `<canvas>` element we just created, and then provide the merchant with the option of either approving or denying the signature.

First, we'll draw the signature. In `index.js`:

```diff
CloverConnectorListener.prototype.onDeviceError = function(deviceErrorEvent) {
  window.alert(`Message: ${deviceErrorEvent.getMessage()}`);
};

+ CloverConnectorListener.prototype.onVerifySignatureRequest = function(verifySignatureRequest) {
+   // clear any previous signatures, draw the current signature
+   var canvas = document.getElementById("verify-signature-canvas");
+   var ctx = canvas.getContext('2d');
+   ctx.clearRect(0, 0, canvas.width, canvas.height);
+   ctx.scale(0.25, 0.25);
+   ctx.beginPath();
+   for (var strokeIndex = 0; strokeIndex < verifySignatureRequest.getSignature().strokes.length; strokeIndex++) {
+     var stroke = verifySignatureRequest.getSignature().strokes[strokeIndex];
+     ctx.moveTo(stroke.points[0].x, stroke.points[0].y);
+     for (var pointIndex = 1; pointIndex < stroke.points.length; pointIndex++) {
+       ctx.lineTo(stroke.points[pointIndex].x, stroke.points[pointIndex].y);
+       ctx.stroke();
+     }
+   }
+   // reset the scale so clearing the previous signature will function as intended
+   ctx.scale(4, 4);
+ };
```

Then, we'll present the merchant with the option of accepting or rejecting the transaction, based on verifying the signature. Due to the asynchronous nature of drawing on an html canvas, we use `setTimeout()` to enqueue this code in the call stack. Otherwise, the confirm dialog will appear before the signature has been drawn.

```diff
CloverConnectorListener.prototype.onVerifySignatureRequest = function(verifySignatureRequest) {
  // clear any previous signatures, draw the current signature
  var canvas = document.getElementById("verify-signature-canvas");
  var ctx = canvas.getContext('2d');
  ctx.clearRect(0, 0, canvas.width, canvas.height);
  ctx.scale(0.25, 0.25);
  ctx.beginPath();
  for (var strokeIndex = 0; strokeIndex < verifySignatureRequest.getSignature().strokes.length; strokeIndex++) {
    var stroke = verifySignatureRequest.getSignature().strokes[strokeIndex];
    ctx.moveTo(stroke.points[0].x, stroke.points[0].y);
    for (var pointIndex = 1; pointIndex < stroke.points.length; pointIndex++) {
      ctx.lineTo(stroke.points[pointIndex].x, stroke.points[pointIndex].y);
      ctx.stroke();
    }
  }
  // reset the scale so clearing the previous signature will function as intended
  ctx.scale(4, 4);
+ 
+ // present the merchant with the option of approving or denying the signature
+ 
+ // due to the asynchronous nature of drawing on an html canvas, we need to
+ // enqueue this in the message queue to be executed when the call stack is
+ // empty. otherwise, the confirm dialog will appear before the signature
+ // has rendered.
+ setTimeout(function() {
+   if (confirm("Would you like to approve this signature?")) {
+     // accept or reject, based on the merchant's input
+     this.cloverConnector.acceptSignature(verifySignatureRequest);
+   } else {
+     this.cloverConnector.rejectSignature(verifySignatureRequest);
+   }
+ }.bind(this), 0);
};
```

Refresh the webpage, reconnect to the Clover device, initiate another Sale, and accept the signature. You have now completed your first `remote-pay-cloud` Sale! ðŸŽ‰ 

But don't ship this code to production just yet. Start *another* Sale, proceed through the transaction lifecycle using the **same card** as you just used, and you will be presented with this screen, again being "stuck". Let's discuss how to proceed.

### Working with Challenges

By using the same payment card twice in quick succession, we have triggered a `DUPLICATE_CHALLENGE`, which we'll need to resolve in the `CloverConnectorListener#onConfirmPaymentRequest` callback. You can read more about working with Challenges [here](https://docs.clover.com/build/working-with-challenges/). Let's render all possible challenges, and then give the merchant the option to approve, or reject the payment.

If we're resolving the last challenge in the Challenges array, we want a merchant input of 'OK' to actually accept the Payment.

```diff
    setTimeout(function() {
      if (confirm("Would you like to approve this signature?")) {
        // accept or reject, based on the merchant's input
        this.cloverConnector.acceptSignature(verifySignatureRequest);
      } else {
        this.cloverConnector.rejectSignature(verifySignatureRequest);
      }
    }.bind(this), 0);
  };
+
+  CloverConnectorListener.prototype.onConfirmPaymentRequest = function(confirmPaymentRequest) {
+    for (var i = 0; i < confirmPaymentRequest.getChallenges().length; i++) {
+      // boolean of whether or not we are resolving the last challenge in the Challenges array
+      var isLastChallenge = i === confirmPaymentRequest.getChallenges().length - 1;
+    
+      if (confirm(confirmPaymentRequest.getChallenges()[i].getMessage())) {
+        if (isLastChallenge) {
+          this.cloverConnector.acceptPayment(confirmPaymentRequest.getPayment());
+        }
+      } else {
+        this.cloverConnector.rejectPayment(confirmPaymentRequest.getPayment(), confirmPaymentRequest.getChallenges()[i]);
+        return;
+      }
+    }
+  };
```

Start a new Sale, ensure you're able to resolve the `DUPLICATE_CHALLENGE`, and then let's move on to the next section.

### Did the Sale Succeed?

Now, our POS needs to know whether or not the sale succeeded, so we can update our UI accordingly. We've previously used the `SaleRequest` class and `CloverConnector#sale` method to initiate a transaction, and now we'll use the `SaleResponse` class and `CloverConnectorListener#onSaleResponse` method to determine what actually occurred in the transaction.

We'll use the [toLocaleString](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Number/toLocaleString) method on the JavaScript `Number` class to handle number formatting. Refer to its browser compatibility table, and replace with a different library, or code, depending on your own POS's preferences and browser compatibility requirements.

In `index.js`:

```diff
CloverConnectorListener.prototype.onConfirmPaymentRequest = function(confirmPaymentRequest) {
  for (var i = 0; i < confirmPaymentRequest.getChallenges().length; i++) {
    // boolean of whether or not we are resolving the last challenge in the Challenges array
    var isLastChallenge = i === confirmPaymentRequest.getChallenges().length - 1;
    
    if (confirm(confirmPaymentRequest.getChallenges()[i].getMessage())) {
      if (isLastChallenge) {
        this.cloverConnector.acceptPayment(confirmPaymentRequest.getPayment());
      }
    } else {
      this.cloverConnector.rejectPayment(confirmPaymentRequest.getPayment(), request.getChallenges()[i]);
      return;
    }
  }
};
+ 
+ CloverConnectorListener.prototype.onSaleResponse = function(saleResponse) {
+   if (saleResponse.getSuccess()) {
+     var saleResponseAmount = saleResponse.getPayment().getAmount();
+     var formattedSaleResponseAmount = (saleResponseAmount / 100).toLocaleString("en-US", {style: "currency", currency: "USD"});
+     alert(`Sale was successful for ${formattedSaleResponseAmount}!`);
+   } else {
+     alert(`${saleResponse.getReason()} â€” ${saleResponse.getMessage()}`);
+   }
+ };
```

A `SaleRequest` will now `alert` us when it is complete, and let us know whether or not it succeeded. Refresh the page, process another transaction, and you should see the "Sale was successful...!" dialog.

You'll now probably want to test that failed transactions behave as expected, as well. The test card we have shipped you with your DevKit should *always* succeed. We'll need to use a certain test card in order to simulate a decline at the payment gateway. And we'll need to be able to manually enter the card information onto the Clover device. Let's implement a way to do that, first.

First, let's update the POS's UI to allow the merchant to toggle the Clover into prompting for a manually entered card.

In `index.html`:

```diff
<div class="numpad--row row">
  <div class="numpad--key double" id="key--00">00</div>
  <div class="numpad--key" id="key--0">0</div>
  <div class="numpad--key triple" id="key--del">Del</div>
</div>

- <!-- TODO: Create a checkbox for manual card entry -->
+ <div class="row">
+   <div class="col-xs-12">
+     <label>
+       <input type="checkbox" id="checkbox-manual-card-entry"/> Manual card entry?
+     </label>
+   </div> 
+ </div>
+
<div class="numpad--row row">
  <div class="numpad--key key--primary" id="key--charge">Charge</div>
</div>
```

And if that checkbox is checked, we'll initiate a `SaleRequest` with a manual card entry method. In `index.js`:

```diff
RemotePayCloudTutorial.prototype.performSale = function(amount) {
  var saleRequest = new clover.remotepay.SaleRequest();
  saleRequest.setAmount(amount);
  saleRequest.setExternalId(clover.CloverID.getNewId());
+  if (document.getElementById("checkbox-manual-card-entry").checked) {
+    saleRequest.setCardEntryMethods(clover.CardEntryMethods.CARD_ENTRY_METHOD_MANUAL);
+    document.getElementById("checkbox-manual-card-entry").checked = false;
+  }
  this.cloverConnector.sale(saleRequest);
};
```

Now, start a manually-entered sale, and enter the following card information when prompted:

```
PAN: 4005571702222222
CVV: 123
Expiration date: Anytime in the future
```

After proceeding through the entire transaction lifecycle, `CloverConnectorListener#onSaleResponse` should trigger, and `alert` us that the payment has failed. Nice!

**Note:** Interchange fees may be higher for manually entered card transactions, compared to swipe/dip/tap. However, we strongly recommend implementing an option in your POS to allow your merchants to enter cards manually. Allowing your merchant to accept manually entered cards can serve as a backup in case the cardholder has a damaged mag stripe or EMV chip.

### Handling Partial Auths

A successful card transaction does not necessarily guarantee that the entire `amount` of the `SaleRequest` was authorized. For example, a prepaid Visa/Mastercard Gift Card might only have enough funds to partially cover the full transaction amount. This is called a **Partial Auth**. Your industry might make you more susceptible to Partial Auths, depending on the payment options available to cardholders (e.g., HSA debit cards could also lead to a higher frequency of Partial Auths).

Our POS should determine if a Partial Auth occurred. If it did, a new `SaleRequest` should be initiated, for the amount that was *not* paid for by the first transaction. We will use the `localStorage` API to keep track of the `amount` that was used in the initiating `SaleRequest`, and compare it to the amount that was actually authorized in its corresponding `SaleResponse`.

In `index.js`:

```diff
// perform a sale
RemotePayCloudTutorial.prototype.performSale = function(amount) {
  var saleRequest = new clover.remotepay.SaleRequest();
  saleRequest.setAmount(amount);
  saleRequest.setExternalId(clover.CloverID.getNewId());
  if (document.getElementById("checkbox-manual-card-entry").checked) {
    saleRequest.setCardEntryMethods(clover.CardEntryMethods.CARD_ENTRY_METHOD_MANUAL);
    document.getElementById("checkbox-manual-card-entry").checked = false;
  }
+  // localStorage will store the amount as a string, even though it's an int
+  window.localStorage.setItem("lastTransactionRequestAmount", amount);
  this.cloverConnector.sale(saleRequest);
};
```

It will be nice to have access to the `performSale` helper method on the `RemotePayCloudTutorial` instance we're creating in `index.js`.

```diff
+ var remotePayCloudTutorial;

// class definition
RemotePayCloudTutorial = function() {
  this.merchant_id = window.location.href.match(/merchant_id=([^&]*)/)[1];
  this.access_token = window.location.href.match(/access_token=([^&]*)/)[1];
  this.targetCloverDomain = window.location.href.includes("localhost") ? "https://sandbox.dev.clover.com" : "https://www.clover.com";
  this.remoteApplicationId = "com.tutorial.remote.pay.cloud";
+  remotePayCloudTutorial = this;
};
```

And now, we can implement the logic of Partial Auth handling.

```diff
CloverConnectorListener.prototype.onSaleResponse = function(saleResponse) {
  if (saleResponse.getSuccess()) {
+    // convert the stored string back to an int
+    var saleRequestAmount = parseInt(window.localStorage.getItem("lastTransactionRequestAmount"));
+    // returns an int, so comparison is allowed
    var saleResponseAmount = saleResponse.getPayment().getAmount();
+    
+    // a partial auth occurred if the Payment amount was less than the TransactionRequest amount
+    var wasPartialAuth = saleResponseAmount < saleRequestAmount;
+    
    var formattedSaleResponseAmount = (saleResponseAmount / 100).toLocaleString("en-US", {style: "currency", currency: "USD"});
+    if (wasPartialAuth) {
+      var remainingBalance = saleRequestAmount - saleResponseAmount;
+      var formattedRemainingBalance = (remainingBalance / 100).toLocaleString("en-US", {style: "currency", currency: "USD"});
+      alert(`Partially authorized for ${formattedSaleResponseAmount} â€” remaining balance is ${formattedRemainingBalance}. Ask the customer for an additional payment method.`);
+      
+      // start another sale for the remaining amount
+      remotePayCloudTutorial.performSale(remainingBalance);
+      
+    } else {
+      alert(`Sale was successful for ${formattedSaleResponseAmount}!`);
+    }
-     alert(`Sale was successful for ${formattedSaleResponseAmount}!`);
  } else {
    alert(`${saleResponse.getReason()} â€” ${saleResponse.getMessage()}`);
  }
};
```

Just like a decline, we'll need a special card to simulate a Partial Auth. Start a manually-entered sale and when prompted, enter the following card information:

```
PAN: 4005578003333335
CVV: 123
Expiration date: Anytime in the future
```

This card number should pay for half of the `amount`. You should now see our POS properly handle Partial Auths, and initiate a new `SaleRequest` with the remaining balance. When you are satisfied with how our POS is handling Partial Auths, you can pay for the remaining balance that the Clover is prompting for.
